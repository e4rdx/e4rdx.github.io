Yes, I started programming because I wanted to create some games. It didn't took long to find out that it's not as easy as I thought. After a couple of fails, I moved on to python. But that's a different story.\\
One day, when I had a lot of time and a lot more programming experience, I decided to try again. So I've choosen the Unreal Engine, the obvious *best* choice for complete beginners...\\
So I played around to understand some of the tools. After some very chaotic learning worlds I thought a first project would be great.

# The arena shooter
The ideas was to have an arena where the player has to defeat waves of enemys. The implementation was not ... that good. Look at this professional map:

But there was a player with movement and a shooting system:

There was also a small main menu I was very proud of.\\
List of features:
* AI spawner
* TODO: Finish list

# Defend the town
Lets move on to the next fail. After some work on the shooter, I was bored of it. So I had a new idea: Place some towers on a map and at the end a small town. Then, spawn waves of enemys and let the player defend the towers, like a third-person tower defence game:

The red spheres are the locations of the towers to defend. The AI's are starting from the left and the town should be at the right. There's a lake in the middle and a valley at the left.
There were two types of enemys, destroying the walls and/or attacking the player:

Here's my main menu:

One thing I've learned: Good lightning is hard.
Now, something I'm very proud of: A skill tree:

You are able to unlock those things with skillpoints! There is a system for saving and loading the skilltree!\\
List of features:

# Multiplayer shooter
This is the project which became Clone League later on, which is my greatest project so far. So it deserves its own blog entry!

# Restart with Godot Engine
