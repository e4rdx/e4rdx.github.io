When I had a first look at networking with UE, I thought: No way, that's too hard! I'll be never good enough to create any game with networking!\\
But then I just started and after a lot of confusion, I got it! Now, as I'm writing this, CL is my greatest 3D game. I'm very proud of it, even it is full of bugs and not really playable. For programming I used the UE Blueprint system, not a single line of C++.\\
In this entry I want to present all my achievments. Lets start with the main menu:

As you can see my lightning skill didn't became better...\\
Anyways, the news box requests the news by http request(if the server is running). The menu at the top has no functions, but the menu at the right is working. You're able to join a game or just host a game with various options:

Lets go back to the main menu. There's a level system with a hundred tiers. You're able to unlock emotes and skins for your character, which you can equip under "Select Character". Here's the progress section:

Now we'll have a look in the game:

First thing to notice: My leveldesign skills improved!\\
Second thing to notice: I got 5 FPS! You may think now: Wait, why??? So, running two instances of the game is a little to much for my pc. The game is also a gpu killer, but I don't know the reason. There are greater games which are *not* melting down my gpu.\\
Lets move on. The weird white boxes should be an inventory. There are three types of ammo which are spawning around the map. Yes, I managed to create a multiplayer inventory system :) \\
At the right next to the player you can see the explosive gas tanks. Heres another part of the map:

## Why "Clone League"?
At some point I thought that I need a concept behind the game:\\
In the future, they invented a tech to clone humans. So the best gamers fight in a league where they control real humans, clones. The player is part of that league. Following this concept I wanted to design UI and so on...

## What I've learned from this project
I learned so much about Unreal and 3D GameDev. But the most important thing is that I noticed how much work is behind games, especially great titles like WatchDogs. GameDev is hard alone, as a programmer waiting for the free for the month assets in the marketplace. Without a good team you won't reach much if you plan something big.
